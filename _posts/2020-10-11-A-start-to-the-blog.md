# A new start

Welcome to the first in a series of posts revolving around *software development*.
I have decided that to push myself a bit more in terms of developing my skillset by adding new languages and tools to my workflow, I will try to right about the experience and how I went about things, as well as including walk through guidwes for some of the more useful things that I will be learning.

This is just a quick note to say the first real post with substance should be along in the next few days.

Until next time...
Nic
