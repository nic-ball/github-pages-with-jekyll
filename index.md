# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are happened upon me, I'll be discussing my journey to improve as a developer. Along witn some other musings about some of my interests.

First up is getting my git/github skills to a more advanced level and this blog is basically the test piece. So things might not be overly stunning to start with.

Stay tuned for some updates.
